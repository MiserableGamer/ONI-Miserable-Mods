# No Disease

Completely disables the disease system - not just immunity, but removes disease mechanics entirely from the game.

## Features

- **No Germs** - All existing germs are wiped from the world on load
- **No Disease Spread** - Germs cannot spread through air, water, or pipes
- **No Infections** - Duplicants cannot get sick from germs
- **No Disease UI** - Disease overlay and panels are hidden
- **No Disease Tools** - Disinfect tool is removed
- **Hidden Buildings** - Disease-related buildings are deprecated

## How to Use

1. **Install the Mod** - Enable in the Mods menu
2. **Load Your Save** - Existing germs will be removed automatically
3. **Play Disease-Free** - No further action needed

### Tips

- This is an interim solution while FastTrack is updated
- Apothecary is kept when Radiation DLC is enabled (needed for rad pills)
- Great for players who find disease tedious or want better performance
- Safe to add to existing saves - germs are wiped on load
