[h1]No Disease[/h1]
Completely disables the disease system in Oxygen Not Included - not just immunity, but removes disease mechanics entirely from the game.

[b][i]Note: This mod is intended as an interim solution until [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967921388]FastTrack[/url] by Peter Han is updated for the current game version. If you only want the "No Disease" functionality without FastTrack's other features, this standalone mod is for you. This mod will be removed from the workshop if requested by other modders.[/i][/b]
