# Copy Tile Tool

Replace tiles in bulk by selecting a destination type, then a source type to replace, then drag-selecting an area.

## Features

- **Tile Type Replacement** - Change tiles from one type to another (e.g., Standard Tile → Mesh Tile)
- **Exact Matching** - Only replaces tiles with the same type AND material as your source
- **Bulk Replacement** - Drag to select multiple tiles at once
- **Safe Replacement** - Queues deconstruction and reconstruction through normal game systems
- **All Tile Types** - Works with Standard, Mesh, Airflow, Insulated, Metal, Plastic, Bunker, Carpet, Window, and all DLC tiles

## How to Use

1. **Select Destination Tile** - Click on a tile that represents what you want tiles to become
2. **Click "Copy Tile" Button** - In the tile's side screen, click the "Copy Tile" button
3. **Select Source Tile** - Click on a tile of a DIFFERENT type that you want to replace
4. **Drag to Apply** - Drag over the area to queue replacements for all matching tiles

### Tips

- This tool is for changing tile **types** (e.g., Standard Tile → Mesh Tile)
- For changing tile **materials** only (e.g., Sandstone Tile → Granite Tile), use the [Copy Materials Tool](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3626072188) instead ([GitHub](https://github.com/MiserableGamer/ONI-Miserable-Mods/tree/master/CopyMaterialsTool))
- Only tiles that exactly match the destination (both type AND material) will be replaced
- If the source and destination are the same tile type, the tool will reject the selection

## Known Issues

- **TrueTiles Texture on First Replacement**: When using the [TrueTiles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951717779) mod, tiles created by Copy Tile Tool will display correctly with TrueTiles textures. However, the **first** tile built over a Copy Tile Tool-created tile (using normal build tools) may show the default game texture instead of the TrueTiles texture. Saving and reloading the game, will restore the correct TrueTiles texture. This is a visual-only issue and does not affect gameplay.

## Performance

**Minimal Performance Impact**


## Future Updates

- Visual feedback improvements during drag selection
- Additional tile type support as new content is released
