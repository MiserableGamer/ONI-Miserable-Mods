[*]This tool is for changing tile [b]types[/b] (e.g., Standard Tile → Mesh Tile)
[*]For changing tile [b]materials[/b] only (e.g., Sandstone Tile → Granite Tile), use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3626072188]Copy Materials Tool[/url] instead ([url=https://github.com/MiserableGamer/ONI-Miserable-Mods/tree/master/CopyMaterialsTool]GitHub[/url])
[*]Only tiles that exactly match the destination (both type AND material) will be replaced
[*]If the source and destination are the same tile type, the tool will reject the selection
