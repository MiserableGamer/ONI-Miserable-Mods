# Bonbon Tree Boost

Enables the editing of the Bonbon tree, growth, production, and amount of fertilizer needed for domesticated plants.

## Features

✅ **Configurable Nectar Production** - Adjust the multiplier for Space Tree sugar water (nectar) production (0.1x to 10x)

✅ **Growth / Branch Efficiency Control** - Control how quickly Space Trees reach optimal production (0.1x to 5x)

✅ **Fertilizer Consumption Adjustment** - Modify how much Snow fertilizer the trees consume (0x to 5x)

✅ **Fully Configurable** - All settings are adjustable through the mod options menu

✅ **Works with Existing Saves** - Changes apply to existing trees, new trees, and all saves

## Configuration Options

The mod includes three configurable options:

1. **Nectar Production Multiplier** (Default: 2.0x)
   - Multiplier for Space Tree sugar water production
   - Range: 0.1 to 10.0
   - Higher values = more nectar production

2. **Growth / Branch Efficiency Multiplier** (Default: 1.0x)
   - Affects how quickly Space Trees reach optimal production
   - Range: 0.1 to 5.0
   - Higher values = trees reach optimal production faster

3. **Fertilizer Consumption Multiplier** (Default: 1.0x)
   - Multiplier for Snow fertilizer consumption
   - Range: 0.0 to 5.0
   - Set to 0.0 to disable fertilizer consumption entirely

## How It Works

The mod modifies the Space Tree's production mechanics by adjusting:
- **Production Duration**: Lower duration means more frequent production cycles
- **Branch Requirements**: Adjusts how many branches are needed for optimal production
- **Fertilizer Consumption Rate**: Directly modifies the mass consumption rate of Snow fertilizer

Changes are applied when trees are created, affecting both existing and new trees in your save.

## Compatibility

- ✅ All DLCs supported (Base Game, Spaced Out!, The Frosty Planet Pack, The Bionic Booster Pack)
- ✅ Minimum Build: 700386
- ✅ API Version: 2
- ⚠️ **Restart Required**: Game restart is required after changing mod options
