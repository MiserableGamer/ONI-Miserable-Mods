[h2]Configuration Options[/h2]
The mod includes configurable options organized into groups:

[h3]Wild Trees[/h3]
[olist]
[*][b]Nectar Production Multiplier[/b] (Default: 2.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for wild Space Tree sugar water production
[*]Range: 1.0 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = more nectar production
[/list]
[*][b]Trunk Growth Rate[/b] (Default: 1.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for wild Space Tree trunk growth rate
[*]Range: 0.1 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = trunk grows faster
[/list]
[*][b]Branch Growth Rate[/b] (Default: 1.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for wild Space Tree branch growth rate
[*]Range: 0.1 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = branches grow faster
[/list]
[/olist]

[h3]Domesticated Trees[/h3]
[olist]
[*][b]Nectar Production Multiplier[/b] (Default: 2.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for domesticated Space Tree sugar water production
[*]Range: 1.0 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = more nectar production
[/list]
[*][b]Trunk Growth Rate[/b] (Default: 1.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for domesticated Space Tree trunk growth rate
[*]Range: 0.1 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = trunk grows faster
[/list]
[*][b]Branch Growth Rate[/b] (Default: 1.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for domesticated Space Tree branch growth rate
[*]Range: 0.1 to 10.0
[*]Higher values = branches grow faster
[/list]
[*][b]Fertilizer Consumption Rate[/b] (Default: 1.0x)
[list]
[*]Multiplier for Snow fertilizer consumption (domesticated trees only)
[*]Range: 0.0 to 10.0
[*]Set to 0.0 to disable fertilizer consumption entirely
[*]Higher values = trees consume more fertilizer
[/list]
[/olist]

[h3]Production Balance[/h3]
[olist]
[*][b]Wild vs Domestic Production Balance[/b] (Default: 3 - Wild Advantage)
[list]
[*]Controls the production relationship between wild and domesticated trees
[*]Options:
[list]
[*][b]1 = Domestic Advantage[/b]: Domestic trees produce more than wild trees
[*][b]2 = Equal Production[/b]: Wild and domestic trees produce the same rate
[*][b]3 = Wild Advantage[/b]: Wild trees produce more than domestic trees
[/list]
[*]Combined with the Production Advantage Multiplier to determine the exact ratio
[/list]
[*][b]Production Advantage Multiplier[/b] (Default: 2.0x)
[list]
[*]When balance is set to Domestic Advantage (1) or Wild Advantage (3), this controls how much more one produces than the other
[*]Range: 0.5 to 10.0
[*]Example: 2.0 means the advantaged type produces 2x more than the other
[/list]
[/olist]

[h3]Branch Settings[/h3]
[olist]
[*][b]Allow Branch Harvesting[/b] (Default: Enabled)
[list]
[*]If disabled, branches cannot be harvested for wood
[*]Dupes will only harvest nectar from the trunk
[*]If enabled, dupes can harvest both nectar and wood from branches
[/list]
[/olist]

[h2]How It Works[/h2]
The mod modifies the Space Tree's mechanics by adjusting:
[list]
[*][b]Production Duration[/b]: Lower duration means more frequent production cycles (affects nectar production rate)
[*][b]Growth Rates[/b]: Modifies the trunk and branch growth rates independently for wild and domesticated trees
[*][b]Fertilizer Consumption Rate[/b]: Directly modifies the mass consumption rate of Snow fertilizer (domesticated trees only)
[*][b]Production Balance[/b]: Allows you to control whether wild or domesticated trees are more productive, or if they produce equally
[*][b]Branch Harvesting[/b]: Controls whether branches can be harvested for wood or only nectar is collected
[/list]

Changes are applied when trees are created, affecting both existing and new trees in your save.
