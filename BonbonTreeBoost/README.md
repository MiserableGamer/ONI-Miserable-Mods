# Bonbon Tree Boost Mod

A mod for Oxygen Not Included that allows you to configure the Bonbon Tree (Space Tree) Nectar production, growth speed, and fertilizer consumption to suit your gameplay needs.

## Features

- **Configurable Nectar Production**: Adjust the multiplier for Space Tree sugar water (nectar) production (0.1x to 10x)
- **Growth / Branch Efficiency Control**: Control how quickly Space Trees reach optimal production (0.1x to 5x)
- **Fertilizer Consumption Adjustment**: Modify how much Snow fertilizer the trees consume (0x to 5x)
- **Fully Configurable**: All settings are adjustable through the mod options menu
- **Works with Existing Saves**: Changes apply to existing trees, new trees, and all saves

## Configuration Options

The mod includes three configurable options accessible through the mod options menu:

1. **Nectar Production Multiplier** (Default: 2.0x)
   - Multiplier for Space Tree sugar water production
   - Range: 0.1 to 10.0
   - Higher values = more nectar production
   - Lower values = less nectar production

2. **Growth / Branch Efficiency Multiplier** (Default: 1.0x)
   - Affects how quickly Space Trees reach optimal production
   - Range: 0.1 to 5.0
   - Higher values = trees reach optimal production faster
   - Lower values = trees take longer to reach optimal production

3. **Fertilizer Consumption Multiplier** (Default: 1.0x)
   - Multiplier for Snow fertilizer consumption
   - Range: 0.0 to 5.0
   - Higher values = trees consume more fertilizer
   - Lower values = trees consume less fertilizer
   - Set to 0.0 to disable fertilizer consumption entirely

## How It Works

The mod modifies the Space Tree's production mechanics by adjusting:
- **Production Duration**: Lower duration means more frequent production cycles
- **Branch Requirements**: Adjusts how many branches are needed for optimal production
- **Fertilizer Consumption Rate**: Directly modifies the mass consumption rate of Snow fertilizer

Changes are applied when trees are created, affecting both existing and new trees in your save.

- **Minimum Build**: 700386
- **API Version**: 2
- Uses PLib for options management
