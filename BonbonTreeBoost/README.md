# Bonbon Tree Boost

Configure the Bonbon Tree (Space Tree) nectar production, growth speed, and fertilizer consumption to suit your gameplay needs.

## Features

- **Separate Wild and Domestic Settings** - Configure wild and domesticated trees independently
- **Configurable Nectar Production** - Adjust multipliers for Space Tree sugar water production (1.0x to 10.0x)
- **Independent Growth Rate Control** - Control trunk and branch growth rates separately (0.1x to 10.0x)
- **Fertilizer Consumption Adjustment** - Modify Snow fertilizer consumption for domesticated trees (0.0x to 10.0x)
- **Production Balance Control** - Choose whether wild or domestic trees produce more
- **Branch Harvesting Control** - Enable or disable wood harvesting from branches
- **Works with Existing Saves** - Changes apply to existing trees, new trees, and all saves

## How to Use

1. **Open Mod Options** - Main Menu → Mods → Bonbon Tree Boost → Options (gear icon)
2. **Configure Wild Trees** - Set nectar production, trunk growth, and branch growth multipliers
3. **Configure Domesticated Trees** - Set nectar production, growth rates, and fertilizer consumption
4. **Set Production Balance** - Choose Wild Advantage, Equal, or Domestic Advantage
5. **Restart Game** - Changes require a game restart to take effect

### Tips

- Set fertilizer consumption to 0.0 to disable fertilizer requirements for domesticated trees
- Use the Production Balance setting to control which tree type produces more
- Branch harvesting can be disabled if you only want nectar production
- Growth rate changes affect how quickly trees mature
