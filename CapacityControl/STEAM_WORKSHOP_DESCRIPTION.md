[h1]Capacity Control[/h1]
Increases the storage capacity text input character limit beyond the vanilla 6 characters.

[h2]Problem[/h2]
The vanilla game limits the storage capacity control text input to 6 characters. This means you can only manually type values up to 999,999 kg. When using mods that increase storage capacity beyond this amount, you can use the slider to set higher values, but you cannot manually type specific values larger than 6 digits.

[h2]Solution[/h2]
This mod allows you to configure how many additional characters to add beyond the vanilla limit. By default, it adds 2 extra characters (for 8 total), allowing values up to 9,999,999 kg.
