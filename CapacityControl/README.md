# Capacity Control

Increases the storage capacity text input character limit beyond the vanilla 6 characters, allowing you to type larger storage values.

## Features

- **Configurable Character Limit** - Choose how many extra characters to add (1-10) via mod options
- **Works with All Storage** - Applies to any building that uses the capacity control side screen
- **Compatible with Storage Mods** - Designed to work alongside mods that increase storage capacity

## How to Use

1. **Open Mod Options** - Main Menu → Mods → Capacity Control → Options (gear icon)
2. **Set Additional Characters** - Choose how many extra characters beyond the vanilla 6 limit
3. **Restart Game** - Changes require a game restart to take effect
4. **Type Larger Values** - You can now type larger storage values in any capacity control

### Tips

- Default adds 2 extra characters (8 total), allowing values up to 9,999,999 kg
- Useful when using mods that increase storage capacity beyond 999,999 kg
- The slider can set values beyond the text limit, but typing requires this mod
