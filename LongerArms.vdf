[h2]Mod Collection[/h2] This mod is part of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3613749156]ONI 200+ Ultimate Mods collection[/url] on Steam Workshop, featuring over 200 tested and compatible mods for Oxygen Not Included. [h2]Credits[/h2] [list] [*]Developed for Oxygen Not Included [*]Uses PLib by Peter Han [*]Uses Harmony by pardeike [/list] [h2]Future Functionality[/h2] The following features are planned for future releases: [list] [*][b]Diagonal Reach[/b] - Allow duplicants to reach cells that are diagonally positioned (both above/below and to the side). This would enable reaching corner cells that are currently unreachable even with extended vertical reach. This feature was partially implemented but removed for v1.0 to ensure stability and proper wall collision detection. [*][b]Linked Reach Sliders[/b] - A checkbox option to link the vertical and horizontal reach sliders, so that adjusting one automatically updates the other to match. The last value you set would be applied to both sliders when the link is enabled. [/list] [h2]Version History[/h2] [list] [*][b]0.1.55[/b]: Initial release [/list]"
