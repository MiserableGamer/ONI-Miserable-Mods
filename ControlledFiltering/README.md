# Controlled Filtering

Control which item categories appear as Standard vs Non-Standard in storage filter lists.

## Features

By default, ONI separates storage items into two sections:
- **Standard** - Most items (metals, organics, food, etc.)
- **Non-Standard** - Clothing, Critter Eggs, and Sublimating items

The "Select All Standard" button only affects items in the Standard section.

This mod lets you choose which categories should be treated as Standard vs Non-Standard:

- **Clothing** - Atmo suits, snazzy suits, etc.
- **Critter Eggs** - All critter eggs
- **Sublimators** - Bleach Stone, Oxylite, etc.

## Why Use This?

- **Convenience** - Include eggs or sublimating materials in bulk selection
- **Workflow** - Stop accidentally missing clothing when setting up storage
- **Preference** - Organize storage lists the way you want

## Installation

1. Subscribe on Steam Workshop, or
