# Controlled Filtering

Control which item categories appear as Standard vs Non-Standard in storage filter lists.

## Features

- **Category Control** - Choose which categories are Standard vs Non-Standard
- **Clothing Toggle** - Include/exclude Atmo suits, snazzy suits, etc.
- **Critter Eggs Toggle** - Include/exclude all critter eggs
- **Sublimators Toggle** - Include/exclude Bleach Stone, Oxylite, etc.
- **Bulk Selection** - Make "Select All Standard" work the way you want

## How to Use

1. **Open Mod Options** - Main Menu → Mods → Controlled Filtering → Options (gear icon)
2. **Configure Categories** - Toggle which categories should be Standard vs Non-Standard
3. **Restart Game** - Changes require a game restart to take effect
4. **Use Storage Filters** - "Select All Standard" will now include your configured categories

### Tips

- By default, Clothing, Critter Eggs, and Sublimating items are Non-Standard
- Uncheck an option to move that category to the Standard section
- This affects all storage buildings (bins, refrigerators, etc.)
- Great for quickly selecting eggs or suits with bulk storage operations
