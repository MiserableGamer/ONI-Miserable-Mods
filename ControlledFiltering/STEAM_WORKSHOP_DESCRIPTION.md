[h1]Controlled Filtering[/h1]

Control which item categories appear as Standard vs Non-Standard in storage filter lists.

[h2]The Problem[/h2]

When you click on a storage bin, items are split into two sections:
[list]
[*][b]Standard[/b] - Most items (metals, organics, food, etc.)
[*][b]Non-Standard[/b] - Clothing, Critter Eggs, and Sublimating items
[/list]

The "Select All Standard" button only selects items in the Standard section, meaning you have to manually select Non-Standard items separately.

[h2]The Solution[/h2]

This mod lets you choose which categories should be Standard vs Non-Standard:
[list]
[*][b]Clothing[/b] - Atmo suits, snazzy suits, etc.
[*][b]Critter Eggs[/b] - All critter eggs
[*][b]Sublimators[/b] - Bleach Stone, Oxylite, etc.
[/list]

[h2]Configuration[/h2]

Access options through: [b]Main Menu → Mods → Controlled Filtering → Options[/b] (gear icon)

[b]Options:[/b]
[list]
[*]Clothing is Non-Standard (default: ON)
[*]Critter Eggs are Non-Standard (default: ON)
[*]Sublimating Items are Non-Standard (default: ON)
[/list]

Uncheck any option to move that category to the Standard section.

[b]Note:[/b] Changes require a game restart.
