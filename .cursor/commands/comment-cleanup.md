# Comment Cleanup

Clean up comments in the code to be non-verbose, essential only, and natural non-AI sounding.

## Instructions

Review all comments in the code and:
- Remove verbose explanations and redundant comments
- Keep only essential comments that explain "why" not "what"
- Make comments sound natural and human-written, not AI-generated
- Remove section markers, headers, or overly structured comments
- Simplify remaining comments to be concise and conversational
