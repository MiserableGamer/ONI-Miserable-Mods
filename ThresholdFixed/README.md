# Threshold Walls (Fixed)

Adds new backwall buildings that can be used to divide spaces into rooms like a door, while also acting as a backwall against space like drywall.

## Features

- **Multiple Wall Types** - Five different threshold wall variants to choose from
- **Room Division** - Acts like a door for room division without occupying the cell
- **Space Protection** - Functions as a backwall against space, similar to drywall
- **Automation Support** - Programmable Threshold Wall with LED matrix display
- **Pipe Hiding** - Option to hide pipes and wires (with compatible mods)

## Available Wall Types

- **Threshold Wall** - Basic drywall-style threshold wall
- **Industrial Threshold Wall** - Cautionary pattern threshold wall
- **Metal Threshold Wall** - Metal variant threshold wall
- **Plastic Threshold Wall** - Plastic variant threshold wall
- **Programmable Threshold Wall** - Advanced wall with LED matrix and automation control

## How to Use

1. **Build Threshold Walls** - Place at room boundaries where you want division
2. **Duplicants Pass Through** - They can walk through while rooms stay separate
3. **Use Automation** - Programmable variant responds to automation signals
4. **Enjoy Room Bonuses** - Rooms are properly divided for bonuses and effects

### Tips

- Threshold walls don't block movement like regular walls
- Use them to divide large spaces into multiple rooms
- Programmable variant has LED patterns selectable via automation
- Works great for optimizing room layouts and sizes
