# Romen's Threshold Walls (Fixed) Mod

A mod for Oxygen Not Included that adds new backwall buildings that can be used to divide spaces into rooms like a door. Also acts as a backwall against space like drywall.

## Features

- **Multiple Threshold Wall Types**: Five different threshold wall variants to choose from
  - **Threshold Wall**: Basic drywall-style threshold wall
  - **Industrial Threshold Wall**: Cautionary pattern threshold wall
  - **Metal Threshold Wall**: Metal variant threshold wall
  - **Plastic Threshold Wall**: Plastic variant threshold wall
  - **Programmable Threshold Wall**: Advanced threshold wall with LED matrix display and automation control
- **Room Division**: Acts like a door for room division without occupying the cell
- **Space Protection**: Functions as a backwall against space, similar to drywall
- **Automation Support**: Programmable Threshold Wall can be controlled via automation signals
- **Configurable Options**: Option to hide pipes and wires when using compatible mods

## How It Works

Threshold walls are backwall buildings that mark the edge of a room. Unlike regular walls, they don't occupy the cell space, allowing duplicants and resources to pass through while still dividing rooms for room bonuses and effects.

The **Programmable Threshold Wall** includes:
- **LED Matrix Display**: Shows various patterns that can be selected via automation
- **Room Toggle**: Automation control to enable/disable the threshold wall effect
- **Pathing Toggle**: Automation control to allow/block duplicant pathing
- **Pattern Selection**: Choose from different LED display patterns using automation bits

## Why Use This Mod?

Threshold walls provide a flexible way to:
- **Control Room Boundaries**: Divide spaces into separate rooms without blocking movement
- **Optimize Room Layouts**: Subtract cells from room sizes without occupying space
- **Create Visual Boundaries**: Mark room edges with different aesthetic options
- **Automate Room Control**: Use the programmable variant to dynamically control room boundaries

## Configuration Options

The mod includes one configurable option accessible through the mod options menu:

1. **Hide Pipes and Wires** (Default: Disabled)
   - When enabled, threshold walls will hide pipes and wires behind them (requires compatible mod)
   - Automatically enabled if the DrywallHidesPipes mod is detected

## Compatibility

- **Supported Content**: All DLCs
- **Minimum Build**: 700386
- **API Version**: 2
- Uses PLib for options management
- Compatible with DrywallHidesPipes mod
