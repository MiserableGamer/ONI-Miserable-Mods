[h1]Romen's Threshold Walls (Fixed)[/h1]
Adds new backwall buildings that can be used to divide spaces into rooms like a door. Also acts as a backwall against space like drywall.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]Multiple Threshold Wall Types[/b] - Five different threshold wall variants:
[list]
[*][b]Threshold Wall[/b]: Basic drywall-style threshold wall
[*][b]Industrial Threshold Wall[/b]: Cautionary pattern threshold wall

[*][b]Plastic Threshold Wall[/b]: Plastic variant threshold wall

[*][b]Automation Support[/b] - Programmable Threshold Wall can be controlled via automation signals
[*][b]Configurable Options[/b] - Option to hide pipes and wires when using compatible mods
[/list]

[h2]How It Works[/h2]
Threshold walls are backwall buildings that mark the edge of a room. Unlike regular walls, they don't occupy the cell space, allowing duplicants and resources to pass through while still dividing rooms for room bonuses and effects.

The [b]Programmable Threshold Wall[/b] includes:
[list]
[*][b]LED Matrix Display[/b]: Shows various patterns that can be selected via automation
[*][b]Room Toggle[/b]: Automation control to enable/disable the threshold wall effect
[*][b]Pathing Toggle[/b]: Automation control to allow/block duplicant pathing
[*][b]Pattern Selection[/b]: Choose from different LED display patterns using automation bits
[/list]

[h2]Why Use This Mod?[/h2]
Threshold walls provide a flexible way to:
[list]
[*][b]Control Room Boundaries[/b]: Divide spaces into separate rooms without blocking movement
[*][b]Optimize Room Layouts[/b]: Subtract cells from room sizes without occupying space
[*][b]Create Visual Boundaries[/b]: Mark room edges with different aesthetic options
[*][b]Automate Room Control[/b]: Use the programmable variant to dynamically control room boundaries
[/list]

[h2]Configuration Options[/h2]
The mod includes one configurable option:
[list]
[*][b]Hide Pipes and Wires[/b] (Default: Disabled)
[list]
[*]When enabled, threshold walls will hide pipes and wires behind them (requires compatible mod)
[*]Automatically enabled if the DrywallHidesPipes mod is detected
