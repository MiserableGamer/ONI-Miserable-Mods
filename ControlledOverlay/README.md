# Controlled Overlay

Adds a text input field to the Temperature Overlay's relative temperature slider, allowing you to type exact temperature values instead of struggling with the slider.

## Features

- **Exact Temperature Input**: Type the exact temperature you want to focus on
- **Unit Aware**: Respects your temperature unit preference (°C, °F, K)
- **Replaces Slider Display**: The center temperature display becomes an editable input field
- **Instant Feedback**: Slider snaps to your entered value immediately

## Usage

1. Open the Temperature Overlay (F3 or click the temperature button)
2. Select "Relative Temperature" mode
3. Click on the temperature input field (where it shows the center temperature)
4. Just start typing your target temperature - no need to delete the existing value first
5. Press Enter and the slider will snap to that temperature

## Why This Mod?

The vanilla temperature slider can be frustrating to fine-tune, especially when you need to focus on specific temperature ranges for:
- Monitoring crop temperature requirements
- Checking for overheating equipment
- Managing critter habitats
- Debugging heat transfer issues

## Compatibility

- Works with base game and all DLC
- Does not conflict with other overlay mods
- Does not conflict with CapacityControl or other UI mods

## Version History

- **1.0.1.1**: Initial release - adds temperature input field to relative temperature overlay
